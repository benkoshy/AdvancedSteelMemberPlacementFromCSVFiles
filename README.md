### What does this do?

Allows you to (more easily) create beams in Advanced Steel.

1. Specify a CSV file which maps beam tables, beam sections and layer names.
2. Create a .dwg file with lines corresponding to what you've created in the csv file above.
3. Run the command and now you will have a whole bunch of Advanced Steel beams.
